## v 0.2
We did forget few things for the Base Demo Content Release, mainly because I messed some resources with a work-in-progress extension, my bad, so here is a quick patch.

	new :
	* Baked Scene baked using Adaptative Probe Volume
	* TerrainDetails shader Color Control


	added : 
	* WindZone for trees


	fix :
	* missing Rocks “Goldveins” Materials (cave area)
	* Missing River Material
	* Some Rocks Overgrowth Prefab LOD_0 layer was “HiddenRuntime” changed to “Default”, causing the LOD_0 to be culled from the main camera
	* FireCampVFX particles layermask changed to “TransparentVFX”
	* Remove missing scripts
	* Remove the “Terrain” LayerMask, changed “Terrains” to “Default”
